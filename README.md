Things I play with, perhaps useful for anybody else

chart_time_price_volume_logscale.rb
===================================
Displays CSV data from `https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume` on log scale. Colors the volume bars according to the price delta at the corresponding interval. Annotates the min, max and closing values.

Usage:

* grab e.g. `https://data.bitcoinity.org/export_data.csv?currency=USD&data_type=price_volume&t=lb&timespan=30d&vu=curr`
* `./chart_time_price_volume_logscale.rb /tmp/bitcoinity_data.csv`
* `eog /tmp/ctpvl_output.png`

chords.vim
==========
Highlights lines with chords, solos, chord explanations

Usage:

* write lyrics + chords on separate lines
* solos with `ùÖ† ` at the beginning of line
* chord explanations like `Chord        x-x-0-2-1-1`
* you can use repetitions like `[:6x ....  :]`
* comments like `( .... )` at the end of chord line
* objects like `Lyrics, music: Autor`, `R:`, `Intro:` ...
* keep enough spaces after chords so they can be transposed without formatting loss
* chords.vim compatible examples at `https://github.com/ins-pirat-ion/chords-and-tabs`
* `:source /path/to/chords.vim` or put `chords.vim` to `$VIMRUNTIME/syntax` and `:se syntax=chords`
* to obtain printable output use `:source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/2html.vim`

chords_transpose.rb
===================
Transposes chords and solos in plain text.

* Expects format understandable by `chords.vim`
* Usage
```
chords_transpose.rb -f E -t C# -b < song_in_E > song_in_C#
```
* parameters
  * `-f <FROM>` from key
  * `-t <TO>` to key
  * `-q <QUINTS>` how many quints to shift (if provided, `-f` and `-t` are ignored)
  * `-b` prefer flat in output
  * `-H` use German musical nomenclature (H instead of B, B means Bb)
  * `-h` usage

* limitations
  * Doesn't transpose chord explanations
  * Doesn't transpose in comments, objects, non-chord, non-solo lines
